# Manual Netlify Deployment Instructions

## Quick Steps for Manual Upload

### Step 1: Download Your Project
1. In Replit, click **Files** in the left sidebar
2. Click the **3 dots menu** next to your project name
3. Select **"Download as ZIP"**
4. Save the ZIP file to your computer
5. **Extract/Unzip** the downloaded file

### Step 2: Deploy to Netlify
1. Go to **[netlify.com](https://netlify.com)** and create a free account
2. Click **"Sites"** in your dashboard
3. Scroll down to **"Want to deploy a new site without connecting to Git?"**
4. Click **"Browse to upload"** or drag & drop area

### Step 3: Upload Your Files
**IMPORTANT:** Upload your entire project folder, not individual files

1. **Drag your entire extracted project folder** into the Netlify upload area
2. **OR** click "Browse" and select your entire project folder
3. Netlify will automatically:
   - Detect your `netlify.toml` configuration
   - Run `npm run build` 
   - Deploy your built website
   - Activate your contact forms

### Step 4: Get Your Live Website
- Netlify will give you a URL like: `amazing-site-123.netlify.app`
- Your contact forms will work immediately
- Form submissions appear in Netlify dashboard under "Forms"

## Important Files in Your Project:
- `netlify.toml` - Tells Netlify how to build your site
- `_redirects` - Handles React routing
- Contact forms with `data-netlify="true"` - Will work automatically

## Troubleshooting:
- **If build fails:** Check the deploy logs in Netlify dashboard
- **If forms don't work:** Make sure you uploaded the entire project folder
- **If pages don't load:** The `_redirects` file handles React routing

Your website is ready for deployment!
